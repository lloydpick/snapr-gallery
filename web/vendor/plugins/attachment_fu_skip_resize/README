AttachmentFuSkipResize
====================

This plugin gives attachment_fu the ability to bypass resizing of your full-size original image. This is useful when you want to make use of automatic :resize_to scaling on your image class, but only after the user performs a recentering, crop or other manual operation on a higher resolution saved image. This solves a key issue with Kropper, where the image is usually auto-scaled down, saved, manually cropped, and then scaled in a *lossy* manner back up to the defined :resize_to resolution.

In your attachment_fu image class, add..

    attr_accessor :skip_resize 

Any time you want to save an image *without* invoking resizing on the original image..

	image.skip_resize = true
	image.save

Thumbnails will be generated at their defined resolutions regardless of the skip_resize flag.
